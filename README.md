# covid-data
This is an app which visualizes historical data about COVID-19. To use, select a country and the site will load a graph with total cases/deaths over time.

Check it out here!

Note: This app can be rather slow to load initially, you may see a timeout error with Heroku initially. Simply reload the page a few times and it should work :)

## Todos
- add easier search queries, e.g should be able to enter "South Korea" instead of "Korea, South"
- general polish on website
